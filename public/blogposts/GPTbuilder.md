A week after OpenAI's Dev Day, I checked out their new tool and... Goodbye overpriced AI tools that are just GPT with a new coat of paint.

I tried it out and created my own 'Web Design Wizard,' focusing on modern design styles like the parallax effect. 

It's like having a partner that understands the nuances of your questions and directs you efficiently towards your goals.

I needed a partner who gets my focus in the vast web design umbrella, saving me the hassle of repeated explanations. 

If you focus on Figma or Webflow, try out my Wizard!
