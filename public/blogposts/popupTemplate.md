Ever Woken Up to a Flood of Unwanted Emails?

Remember when you traded your email for a "free" download, only to regret it instantly?

I do. During my quest for a pop-up event checklist, I stumbled upon what seemed like the perfect guide. But there was a catch: my contact details.

Like many of you, I thought, "Why not?" and surrendered my info. It felt like a fair exchange for a useful tool.

But here's where the story takes a turn. The template I received was as basic as they come. And my inbox? Overflowing with spam. A stark reminder of the hidden cost of "free" downloads.

It made me wonder: At what point did we start compromising our data for convenience? Why do we keep falling for these traps?

In retalitation, I've created my own pop-up event checklist, no strings attached. No more trading data for disappointment. Check it out: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uief2xfZxqIeQfLWgPpaqCTl94lO5KLO0w5CSfWu9H0/copy
